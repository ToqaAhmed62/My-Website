    <h2>Traditional Clothing</h2>
      <p>While the traditional outfit of Emirati men is primarily white and sometimes shades of light colors, the women wear black.

The traditional outfit of Emirati women is the Abaya, an elegant, loose, fitting, flowing black cloak. The Abaya is always worn over other clothes. Underneath the cloak, women wear traditional or Western clothes. The dark cover also helps hide the bright-colored garments.</p>
